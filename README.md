Isomorphic Layout Composer (ILC) - layout service that compose a web page from fragment services.
It supports client/server based page composition.

It's key difference and advantage against other solutions lays in the fact that it does page composition isomorphically.
It means that page will be assembled at server side using apps that support server side rendering (SSR) and after that
it will be hydrated at client side so all further navigation will be handled by client side rendering.

Such approach allows to **combine advantages of the
[Micro Frontends](https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html),
[SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) &
[Server Side Rendering](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/rendering-on-the-web#server-rendering) approaches**.

This repository also contains an example of how you can create a front-end that is composed from multiple
applications which work in concert and deliver unified experience.

## Why do I need ILC?

Microservices get a lot of traction these days. They allow multiple teams to work independently from each other, choose
their own technology stacks and establish their own release cycles. Unfortunately, frontend development hasn‚Äôt fully capitalized
yet on the benefits that microservices offer. The common practice for building websites remains ‚Äúthe monolith‚Äù: a single frontend
codebase that consumes multiple APIs.

What if we could have microservices on the frontend? This would allow frontend developers to work together with their backend
counterparts on the same feature and independently deploy parts of the website ‚Äî ‚Äúfragments‚Äù such as Header, Product, and Footer.
Bringing microservices to the frontend requires a layout service that composes a website out of fragments. ILC was developed to solve this need.

## üöÄ Quick start

Check out [demo website available online](http://demo.microfrontends.online/) or go through the steps to spin it up locally:

1. Get familiar with [Installation guide](./docs/installation_guide.md)
1. Clone this repository
1. Run `docker compose up -d`
1. _During first launch or shutdown only._ Run `docker compose run registry npm run seed`
1. PROFIT üòé
    * View logs via `docker compose logs -f --tail=10`
    * Open ILC at http://localhost:8233/
    * Open Registry UI at http://localhost:4001/ & use `root/pwd` credentials to sign in.
    * Shutdown everything with `docker compose down`

More information about demo applications used in this quick start [you can find here](https://github.com/namecheap/ilc-demo-apps).

## üîå Adapters
To conveniently connect various frameworks to ILC we rely on the [ecosystem of the single-spa](https://single-spa.js.org/docs/ecosystem)
provided adapters. However sometimes we need to extend original ones to deliver better integration with ILC.
Here are the list of the adapters that were forked & modified:

*  [React - ilc-adapter-react](https://github.com/namecheap/ilc-adapter-react)
*  [Vue.js - ilc-adapter-vue](https://github.com/namecheap/ilc-adapter-vue)

## Notes

### Why `@portal/`
We're using webpack (a static module bundler) to build each application for our micro-frontend approach. Webpack requires
access to everything it needs to include in the bundle at build time. This means when an app that imports a service,
for example planets importing the fetchWithCache service, webpack will try to bundle the service into the planets bundle.
The built in way to avoid webpack doing this is [webpack externals](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/externals/),
using externals works really well but to avoid having to include a regex for each service I'm using the postfix to signal
to webpack (and developers) that the import is another micro-app/service/front-end. The prefix isn't required if you
would rather include a different postfix or none at all it should work, you'll just have to modify each webpack config
for externals.

### Code splitting
Code splitting is a complicated topic. I'm not going to dive into each facet of it within Webpack, see [Webpacks docs for
that](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/).

In our project code splitting is further complicated because webpack's module format expects to load more modules from
the website root, which will always fail in this project unless webpack is told where to load additional modules. Right
now there is a single example of this,
[done in the people application](https://github.com/namecheap/ilc-demo-apps/blob/master/apps/people/src/people.js#L9).
